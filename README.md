# Segmenting and Clustering Neighborhoods in Monterrey MX
An entrepreneur is interested in opening a small Taco Place in the City of Monterrey, Mexico, and she needs to identify a Neighborhood with not too much competitors but with enough customers for what she is planning to offer. In this project, we get addresses with latitude and longitude values for the City of Monterrey, to be able to locate th best place to open that small Restaurant.

We use the **explore** function from the Foursquare API to explore neighborhoods and get the most common venue categories in each neighborhood, and then use this feature to group the neighborhoods into clusters.

We also use the k-means clustering algorithm to complete this task.

Finally, we use the Folium library to visualize the neighborhoods in Monterrey and their identified clusters.
